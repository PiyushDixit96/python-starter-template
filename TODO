I think we should adopt a `lib/` for any code that, in a perfect world, should be extracted out into a library.

## deployment
grafana timing integration
https://grafana.com for observability
log ingestion service, need to investigate
can kamal work with a registry with container?
flightcontrol on AWS or something like that on azure

## dev
when updating container versions, we need to restart the containers to pick up on the new version, otherwise the persisted versions will not be updated

## commitlint
removing unused import, should catch this specifically

## pytest
https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-pytest/issues/187 weird concurrency issues
https://grok.com/share/bGVnYWN5_db662e27-ebb0-4157-8c26-636ca80f5bbd better default pytest configuration

timeout default for playwright to avoid hanging
test logs are a mess. I need to figure out what pytest is doing and make them sane.
--debug seems to generate a different test log

## ui

## ci
cache py dependencies https://github.com/astral-sh/setup-uv/blob/d837751086f305827240e5292bdf208a757ceef1/src/utils/inputs.ts#L59

1p can hang CI https://1password-devs.slack.com/archives/C03NJV34SSC/p1733764637441309
can we use a op service account locally? Probably not a great idea since no 2f is required
pull mailpit contents (we can't pull screeshots)
distribute tests across databases and redis https://pytest-xdist.readthedocs.io/en/stable/distribution.html
enable verbose debugging on tests when GHA debug is enabled
maybe screenshot comments? https://github.com/ActivityWatch/aw-webui/blob/291da6f2c5e7a6b896f23a4eec5ffed9874321ba/.github/workflows/comment.yml#L69
add console logs to log `page.on("console", lambda msg: print(f"Console Message: {msg.type()}: {msg.text()}"))`


downside with this action is it requires write access to the repo and manages a separate branch. instead we should just add a coverage failure threshold.
```
      # TODO coverage data is not outputting properly right now
      # - name: Add Coverage Comment to PR
      #   id: coverage_comment
      #   uses: py-cov-action/python-coverage-comment-action@v3
      #   with:
      #     GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}
```

https://github.com/tecolicom/actions-use-apt-tools/issues/4 - `sudo apt-get update` does work.

maybe use a different event loop? Faster / less issues with playwright?

```
# TODO this doesn't seem to fix the issue
# https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-pytest/issues/167#issuecomment-1546854047
# def pytest_configure():
#     log.info("pytest_configure: nesting asyncio loop")
#     nest_asyncio.apply()

# TODO we should look into uvloop if we end up doing async tests
# @pytest.fixture(scope="session")
# def event_loop_policy():
#     return uvloop.EventLoopPolicy()
```

## build
add nixpacks cache, waiting on comment from author about how to do this.
push to registry
switch to https://railpack.com/guides/running-railpack-in-production
pull azure build and push stuff into this

## act compat
https://github.com/catthehacker/docker_images/issues/138 - apt tool, still failing on apt-install but not because of missing packages
act --container-architecture linux/amd64 --job web
act --container-architecture linux/amd64 --env OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN="$OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN"

## vs code
file picker search for specific files even though they are in gitignore
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lolacod.exclude-format-on-save ignore ui components
binding for paste as plain text
```
{
    "key": "ctrl+shift+v",
    "command": "editor.action.pasteAs",
    "args": {
        "preferences": [
            "text.plain"
        ]
    }
}
```
