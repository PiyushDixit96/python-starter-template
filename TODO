mailer configuration, with premailer and SMTP integration, need to submit some PRs for this

## js
sentry config, not yet ready for v7 https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/react/features/react-router/
posthog config, fix when v7 is released
add posthog usage example
logging config fine on the client side?
tests from template, https://johnsmilga.com/articles/2024/10/15
add middleware to client to catch authorization errors, create non-clerk-provider layout on the frontend
think through authenticated pattern, create a clientLoader action

## ui
better login page

## deployment
https://grafana.com for observability
  log ingestion service, need to investigate
can kamal work with a registry with container?
flightcontrol on AWS or something like that on azure

## dev
fastapi dev conflicts with pdbr interactions, should allow fastapi logs to be funneled elsewhere; maybe we can detect breakpoint usage and do this automatically
should we use sops? Probably can just use 1p, think about mutation risks here https://github.com/getsops/sops?tab=readme-ov-file#yaml-json-env-and-ini-type-extensions
`uv pip install --config-setting editable_mode=compat --reinstall -e ./pypi/activemodel` and https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/7028 and https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/commit/9b3bf2dda8a44168326bb38f75bdd47493ee6da7#diff-85c2bb6d4721ed0a146ea51e2bd615dbdf2249ad3714adc1cacc1877707cadeeR161
https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/9258#issuecomment-2488597047 - looks like local dev dependencies are supported?
autogen'd localalias based on ENV port config

## commitlint
removing unused import, should catch this specifically

## production
should we add justfile to run production scripts? Probably not. Should document.

## template
https://github.com/fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template/blob/master/copier.yml - looks like there is some copy tool I can use? to make this template easy to copy.

## Emailer
https://github.com/Miksus/red-mail/issues/92 - no async support, no update in a year
https://github.com/alex-oleshkevich/mailers - async support
support pre-mailer + support markdown: https://github.com/alex-oleshkevich/mailers

## py test
timeout default for playwright to avoid hanging
