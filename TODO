https://github.com/replicate/cog/blob/c95774f18b8df6f6a7b841be1900153ca04a57ad/python/cog/server/telemetry.py#L7 looks like there is some standard around this

js test build should not include valid sentry token, can we use a console DSN?

## deployment
grafana timing integration
https://grafana.com for observability
log ingestion service, need to investigate
can kamal work with a registry with container?
flightcontrol on AWS or something like that on azure

## dev
if a command running inside a direnv .envrc fails, it doesn't change the exit code https://github.com/direnv/direnv/issues/893
forklift for s3 and remote storage
%load_ext pgcli.magic for ipython
add custom cspell dictionary instead of settings.json
https://github.com/TablePlus/TablePlus/issues/3407 orb stack connections sometimes break
extract playground logic into ipython extension
extract toggle logic into pypi package
fastapi dev conflicts with pdbr interactions, should allow fastapi logs to be funneled elsewhere; maybe we can detect breakpoint usage and do this automatically
should we use sops? Probably can just use 1p, think about mutation risks here https://github.com/getsops/sops?tab=readme-ov-file#yaml-json-env-and-ini-type-extensions
`uv pip install --config-setting editable_mode=compat --reinstall -e ./pypi/activemodel` and https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/7028 and https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/commit/9b3bf2dda8a44168326bb38f75bdd47493ee6da7#diff-85c2bb6d4721ed0a146ea51e2bd615dbdf2249ad3714adc1cacc1877707cadeeR161

autogen'd localalias based on ENV port config, use local
switch to binstall and see if this becomes a binary distribution https://github.com/yukihirop/ultraman/issues/58
look into devenv, maybe a replacement for some of the setup here? https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/blob/master/devenv/sync.py
only look at local .tool-versions instead of the entire system
mermaid postgres integrated into readme https://github.com/bastiensun/pg-mermaid
add some mermaid diagrams to the readme https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devrishik/medical-record-copilot/bc450aa523ba65e3b5a254f422696725512f8c30/README.md

## commitlint
removing unused import, should catch this specifically

## production
should we add justfile to run production scripts? Probably not. Should document.
`{"TimeStamp": "2024-12-17T22:05:33.8744132+00:00", "Log": "INFO   100.100.0.180:49730 - \"GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1\" 200"}` need to improve fastapi structured logging

## pytest
https://grok.com/share/bGVnYWN5_db662e27-ebb0-4157-8c26-636ca80f5bbd better default pytest configuration
https://github.com/flexmock/flexmockc
interesting object matcher here https://github.com/replicate/cog/blob/c95774f18b8df6f6a7b841be1900153ca04a57ad/python/tests/conftest.py#L6-L23
timeout default for playwright to avoid hanging
test logs are a mess. I need to figure out what pytest is doing and make them sane.
--debug seems to generate a different test log

## open source

## ci

1p can hang CI https://1password-devs.slack.com/archives/C03NJV34SSC/p1733764637441309
can we use a op service account locally? Probably not a great idea since no 2f is required
pull mailpit contents (we can't pull screeshots)
distribute tests across databases and redis https://pytest-xdist.readthedocs.io/en/stable/distribution.html
enable verbose debugging on tests when GHA debug is enabled
maybe screenshot comments? https://github.com/ActivityWatch/aw-webui/blob/291da6f2c5e7a6b896f23a4eec5ffed9874321ba/.github/workflows/comment.yml#L69
add console logs to log `page.on("console", lambda msg: print(f"Console Message: {msg.type()}: {msg.text()}"))`


downside with this action is it requires write access to the repo and manages a separate branch. instead we should just add a coverage failure threshold.
```
      # TODO coverage data is not outputting properly right now
      # - name: Add Coverage Comment to PR
      #   id: coverage_comment
      #   uses: py-cov-action/python-coverage-comment-action@v3
      #   with:
      #     GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}
```

https://github.com/tecolicom/actions-use-apt-tools/issues/4 - `sudo apt-get update` does work.

maybe use a different event loop? Faster / less issues with playwright?

```
# TODO this doesn't seem to fix the issue
# https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-pytest/issues/167#issuecomment-1546854047
# def pytest_configure():
#     log.info("pytest_configure: nesting asyncio loop")
#     nest_asyncio.apply()

# TODO we should look into uvloop if we end up doing async tests
# @pytest.fixture(scope="session")
# def event_loop_policy():
#     return uvloop.EventLoopPolicy()
```

## build
add nixpacks cache, waiting on comment from author about how to do this.
push to registry

## act compat
https://github.com/catthehacker/docker_images/issues/138 - apt tool, still failing on apt-install but not because of missing packages
act --container-architecture linux/amd64 --job web
act --container-architecture linux/amd64 --env OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN="$OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN"

## vs code
file picker search for specific files even though they are in gitignore
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lolacod.exclude-format-on-save ignore ui components
binding for paste as plain text
```
{
    "key": "ctrl+shift+v",
    "command": "editor.action.pasteAs",
    "args": {
        "preferences": [
            "text.plain"
        ]
    }
}
```
