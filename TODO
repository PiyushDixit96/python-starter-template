## python
celery types
https://github.com/0xthiagomartins/sqlmodel-controller/blob/main/.coveragerc - automatic coverage
timeout issue https://github.com/celery/celery/issues/3430 and https://github.com/celery/celery/discussions/8692
maybe use griptape? do they have an llm cache?
flower job management, serve through fastapi / uvicorn
understand this https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Don%27t_Do_This#Don.27t_use_upper_case_table_or_column_names
ruff doesn't do everything that pylint does, but it's trying! https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/970
breakpoint() is not protected against by push? is this coming in ruff?
use BaseSettings in pydantic instead of decouple?
fastapi websocket with remix connection
do we need this https://github.com/fastapiutils/fastapi-utils/blob/master/fastapi_utils/guid_type.py?
logging can sometimes get a little crazy, we should come up with better defaults for child loggers
generate plain text from md without template being used for email
understand pytest and how files are collected, any extensions that allow for more clear configuration
gzip serve files, cache static assets as gzip; got to be someone who has done this before
custom py reload, this is taking a ton of resources https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/discussions/2863
TypeID .get doesn't work with an ID string
understand typeid string vs DB UID

## js
sentry config, not yet ready for v7 https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/react/features/react-router/, https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/discussions/12423
posthog config, fix when v7 is released
add posthog usage example
logging config fine on the client side?
add middleware to client to catch authorization errors, create non-clerk-provider layout on the frontend
think through authenticated pattern, create a clientLoader action
fix clerk redirect issue https://discord.com/channels/856971667393609759/1311386772520960182
https://github.com/hey-api/openapi-ts/pull/1378 - better log redirect
better error page, esp when 40x error when loading the client

## deployment
grafana timing integration
https://grafana.com for observability
  log ingestion service, need to investigate
can kamal work with a registry with container?
flightcontrol on AWS or something like that on azure

## dev
fastapi dev conflicts with pdbr interactions, should allow fastapi logs to be funneled elsewhere; maybe we can detect breakpoint usage and do this automatically
should we use sops? Probably can just use 1p, think about mutation risks here https://github.com/getsops/sops?tab=readme-ov-file#yaml-json-env-and-ini-type-extensions
`uv pip install --config-setting editable_mode=compat --reinstall -e ./pypi/activemodel` and https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/7028 and https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/commit/9b3bf2dda8a44168326bb38f75bdd47493ee6da7#diff-85c2bb6d4721ed0a146ea51e2bd615dbdf2249ad3714adc1cacc1877707cadeeR161
https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/9258#issuecomment-2488597047 - looks like local dev dependencies are supported?
autogen'd localalias based on ENV port config, use local
switch to binstall and see if this becomes a binary distribution https://github.com/yukihirop/ultraman/issues/58

## commitlint
removing unused import, should catch this specifically

## production
should we add justfile to run production scripts? Probably not. Should document.

## template
https://github.com/fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template/blob/master/copier.yml - looks like there is some copy tool I can use? to make this template easy to copy.

## py test
timeout default for playwright to avoid hanging

## aicommit
include multiple large changes with comma
if I remove stuff, it counts it as a feature

## open source
localias upstream no caching

## ci
can we use a op service account locally? Probably not a great idea since no 2f is required
https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pytest-pretty why isn't this being picked up?
pull mailpit contents (we can't pull screeshots)
visual diff via comment on playwright

maybe screenshot comments? https://github.com/ActivityWatch/aw-webui/blob/291da6f2c5e7a6b896f23a4eec5ffed9874321ba/.github/workflows/comment.yml#L69

https://github.com/tecolicom/actions-use-apt-tools/issues/4 - `sudo apt-get update` does work.

maybe use a different event loop?

```
# TODO this doesn't seem to fix the issue
# https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-pytest/issues/167#issuecomment-1546854047
# def pytest_configure():
#     log.info("pytest_configure: nesting asyncio loop")
#     nest_asyncio.apply()

# TODO we should look into uvloop if we end up doing async tests
# @pytest.fixture(scope="session")
# def event_loop_policy():
#     return uvloop.EventLoopPolicy()
```

## build
add nixpacks cache, waiting on comment from author about how to do this.
push to registry
--cache-from to speed up builds

## act compat
