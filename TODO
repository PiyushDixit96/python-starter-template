flower job management, serve through fastapi / uvicorn
understand this https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Don%27t_Do_This#Don.27t_use_upper_case_table_or_column_names
ruff doesn't do everything that pylint does, but it's trying! https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/970
breakpoint() is not protected against by push? is this coming in ruff?
use BaseSettings in pydantic instead of decouple?

do we need this https://github.com/fastapiutils/fastapi-utils/blob/master/fastapi_utils/guid_type.py?
logging can sometimes get a little crazy, we should come up with better defaults for child loggers
generate plain text from md without template being used
understand pytest and how files are collected, any extensions that allow for more clear configuration

## js
sentry config, not yet ready for v7 https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/react/features/react-router/
posthog config, fix when v7 is released
add posthog usage example
logging config fine on the client side?
add middleware to client to catch authorization errors, create non-clerk-provider layout on the frontend
think through authenticated pattern, create a clientLoader action
fix clerk redirect issue

## deployment
grafana timing integration
https://grafana.com for observability
  log ingestion service, need to investigate
can kamal work with a registry with container?
flightcontrol on AWS or something like that on azure

## dev
fastapi dev conflicts with pdbr interactions, should allow fastapi logs to be funneled elsewhere; maybe we can detect breakpoint usage and do this automatically
should we use sops? Probably can just use 1p, think about mutation risks here https://github.com/getsops/sops?tab=readme-ov-file#yaml-json-env-and-ini-type-extensions
`uv pip install --config-setting editable_mode=compat --reinstall -e ./pypi/activemodel` and https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/7028 and https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/commit/9b3bf2dda8a44168326bb38f75bdd47493ee6da7#diff-85c2bb6d4721ed0a146ea51e2bd615dbdf2249ad3714adc1cacc1877707cadeeR161

autogen'd localalias based on ENV port config, use local

## commitlint
removing unused import, should catch this specifically

## production
should we add justfile to run production scripts? Probably not. Should document.

## template
https://github.com/fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template/blob/master/copier.yml - looks like there is some copy tool I can use? to make this template easy to copy.

## py test
